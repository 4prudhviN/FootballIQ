# ⚽ FootballIQ

> **Real-time football intelligence platform powered by computer vision, deterministic analytics, and Fireworks AI.**


---

## 🌌 Overview

**FootballIQ** bridges the gap between raw physical movement on the pitch and high-level strategic reasoning. By ingesting video feeds, tracking positional coordinates, and running deterministic sports-science analytics, the platform generates a live game snapshot. This data is orchestrated and dispatched directly to elite open-weight LLMs hosted via Fireworks AI to deliver instant, actionable tactical insights straight to the technical bench.

---

## ⚡ Key Features

* **🤖 Multi-Agent Tactical Dispatcher:** Automatically routes match contexts into dedicated analytical streams (`CoachChat`, `Strategy`, `Opponent`, `Reports`).
* **💬 CoachChat Service:** A live, conversational interface allowing staff to query real-time match telemetry using natural language.
* **🎯 Automated Alert Engine:** Constantly monitors data thresholds to instantly push notifications regarding tactical shifts, positional errors, or player fatigue.
* **🛠️ Robust JSON Repair Pipeline:** Built-in fault tolerance ensures that unstructured LLM outputs are repaired on-the-fly to maintain UI uptime.
* **📊 Cost & Performance Audit:** Built-in simulation scripts to evaluate latency, token efficiency, and operational costs per match.

## ⚙️ Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup
Clone the repository and duplicate the environment template:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/footballiq.git](https://github.com/your-username/footballiq.git)
cd footballiq
cp .env.example .env

```

### 2. Configure Dependencies & Keys

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Populate your `.env` file with your Fireworks credentials:

```env
FIREWORKS_API_KEY=your_secret_fireworks_api_key_here
FIREWORKS_MODEL=accounts/fireworks/models/gpt-oss-120b

```

---

## 🧠 Supported Intelligence Models

You can hot-swap models inside your `.env` configuration instantly without touching the core codebase:

| Model Reference | Primary Target Domain | Strength |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `accounts/fireworks/models/gpt-oss-120b` | General Coaching & Complex Tactics | High contextual comprehension |
| `accounts/fireworks/models/deepseek-r1` | Reasoning-heavy Tasks & Math | Advanced logic & chain-of-thought |

> 💡 *Want to test a new model? Simply update the `FIREWORKS_MODEL` variable in your `.env` or override parameters directly within `config/ai.yaml`.*

---

## 🧪 Testing Suite

FootballIQ features a comprehensive testing pipeline of over **387+ automated checks** to guarantee absolute precision during live matches.

```bash
# Run the entire test suite quietly
python -m pytest tests/ -q

# Test live integration endpoints specifically
python -m pytest tests/test_live_ai.py -v

# Run the automated tactical alert threshold engine tests
python -m pytest tests/test_tactical_alerts.py -v

```

---

## 📈 Production Verification & Cost Estimation

Before executing a live match session, run an end-to-end sandbox verification to measure latency, cost matrix, and token usage metrics:

```bash
# Verify end-to-end API connectivity and response grounding
python scripts/test_fireworks.py

# Simulate seasonal token costs based on target match configurations
python scripts/cost_estimator.py --matches 10 --questions 20 --strategy 5 --reports 3

```

## 🛡️ Troubleshooting

* **`FIREWORKS_API_KEY is not set`:** Ensure your `.env` file exists in the root directory and `python-dotenv` is properly initializing it.
* **`Confidence = 0.0`:** This happens when the model returns coordinates or player IDs that fail grounding validations against the real-time `PipelineContext`. Ensure your mock telemetry is accurately populated.
* **`HTTP 429 Too Many Requests`:** You have hit your Fireworks concurrency limit. You can scale down request intervals or increase retry parameters directly inside `config/ai.yaml`.
